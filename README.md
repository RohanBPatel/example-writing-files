# Practice Quest: Read Me

- Read in the text-file labeled `somenums.txt`
    - save the data into an appropriate array
- Read in the text-file labeled `somewords.txt`
    - save the data into an appropriate array
- Once all data is read in create an ArrayList that alternates the values from each of the arrays you read in

- Write the newly created ArrayList into a file named `mixedup.txt`
    - the values should be separated by `;` when put into the file
